A lot of programmers that you might interview these days are apt to
consider recursion, pointers, and even data structures to be a silly
implementation detail which has been abstracted away by today's many
happy programming languages. "When was the last time you had to write
a sorting algorithm?" they snicker.

Still, I don't really care. I want my ER doctor to understand
anatomy, even if all she has to do is put the computerized
defibrillator nodes on my chest and push the big red button, and I
want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level, even if
Ruby on Rails does read your mind and build a complete Web2.0 social
collaborative networking site for you with three clicks of the mouse.
